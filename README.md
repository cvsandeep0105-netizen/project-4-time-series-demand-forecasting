# 📦 Time Series Demand Forecasting using SARIMAX

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting **monthly product demand** using **time series analysis**.  
Accurate demand forecasting is critical for **inventory planning, cost optimization, and supply chain efficiency**.

We implement a **SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA with Exogenous Variables)** model to capture:
- Trend
- Seasonality
- Temporal dependencies in demand data

This project is designed to reflect **real-world industry practices** used in retail and supply-chain analytics.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem
In real-world retail and supply-chain systems:
- Overstocking increases holding and storage costs
- Understocking leads to lost sales and poor customer experience

📉 **Objective:**  
Predict future demand accurately to enable **data-driven inventory decisions**.

---

## 🗂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains historical order demand data with the following attributes:

| Column | Description |
|------|------------|
| Product_ID | Unique product identifier |
| Product_Code | Product reference code |
| Warehouse | Warehouse location |
| Product_Category | Category of product |
| Date | Order date |
| Order_Demand | Quantity demanded |

📌 The data is **aggregated to monthly frequency** to enable time-series modeling.

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
Key preprocessing steps:
- Converted date column to datetime format
- Aggregated order demand at **monthly level**
- Created a **synthetic monthly time index** (dataset had no native index)
- Applied **log transformation** to stabilize variance
- Ensured **time-aware train–test split** (80% train, 20% test)

---

## 🧠 Feature Engineering
- Monthly time index creation
- Variance stabilization using log transformation
- Preservation of temporal order (no random shuffling)

---

## 📈 Model Selection
### Why SARIMAX?
- Captures **trend and seasonality**
- Handles non-stationary data
- Widely used in **industry demand forecasting**

**Model Configuration:**
- ARIMA order: `(1,1,1)`
- Seasonal order: `(1,1,1,12)`
- Frequency: Monthly

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using:

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- Comparison against a **Naive Baseline Forecast**
- Visual inspection of forecast vs actual demand

📉 The SARIMAX model **outperforms the baseline**, indicating effective learning of demand patterns.

---

## 📉 Results Visualization
The following series are visualized:
- Last portion of training data (context)
- Actual test demand
- SARIMAX forecast

This provides a **clear aligned comparison** between actual demand and model predictions.

---

## 🚀 Business Impact
✔ Improved inventory planning  
✔ Reduced stockouts and excess inventory  
✔ Scalable forecasting framework  

This framework can be extended to:
- Product-level forecasting
- Warehouse-level forecasting
- Promotion-aware or holiday-aware demand forecasting

## 📈 Model Comparison Summary

| Model     | RMSE        | Interpretation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Naive Baseline | High | Unsafe for planning |
| ARIMA | Medium | Captures trend only |
| SARIMAX | Lowest | Best for seasonal demand |

SARIMAX was selected as the final model due to its superior generalization on unseen data.

---

## 🚀 Production Readiness Notes

- Time-aware train-test split used
- Seasonal effects explicitly modeled
- Designed for extension to:
  - Multiple products
  - Multiple warehouses
  - API or dashboard deployment

  ## Results Summary
- Model: SARIMAX (1,1,1)(1,1,1,12)
- Evaluation Metric: RMSE
- Observation: SARIMAX captured overall trend and seasonality.
- Limitation: Small dataset reduces forecast responsiveness.
- Conclusion: Suitable for short-term demand planning.
